# Forgd

## Intro

[Forgd](https://forgd.com) provides tools and services to help blockchain projects launch and manage their token. I joined in March 2024 as a Senior Frontend / UI engineer, with the company scaling rapidly over the next 18 months.

## Role

When I first joined Forgd, they had a monolithic Nuxt application which had been built at speed over the previous 12 months. Like most startup codebases, the code worked, but it was difficult to understand, maintain and scale.

My role over the first 6 months was to get to know the codebase and determine ways to improve it. The first big endeavour was to migrate the codebase to a layered architecture, followed by auditing the fragmented Nuxt UI implementation and owning the migration of that to what would become the "core" component library.

This involved working hand-in-glove with Forgd's designer [Lucas Lopez](https://www.lucaslopezdesign.com/forgd) to implement his detailed Figma designs for a wide range of data-driven components, forms and charts, so page designs could be quickly and reliably realised by the application team.

Responsibilities & impact:

- Owned the design and implementation of the platform’s core component library, used across the application
- Led the migration of a monolithic Nuxt application to a layered architecture, improving separation of concerns and enabling future complexity
- Built and standardised shared systems for components, forms, charts, and layouts, reducing duplication and inconsistency
- Partnered closely with design to translate product requirements into reusable, well-documented UI primitives
- Reverse-engineered and extended Nuxt UI 2 components to meet bespoke product and design needs
- Established frontend conventions and patterns that improved developer velocity and long-term maintainability
